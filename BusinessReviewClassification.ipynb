Burgers are made to order and the meat is put on the grill when you order your sandwich. Getting the small burger just means 1 patty, the regular is a 2 patty burger which is twice the deliciousness. \\n\\nGetting the Cajun fries adds a bit of spice to them and whatever size you order they always throw more fries (a lot more fries) into the bag.\",\n",

      "Visited Monday 11\\/9 because I had won a $20 gift certificate in a golf tournament.  Not knowing anything about the place, we were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the bar\\/restaurant.  There were a few people out on the patio (smokers, kind of a turnoff) but we were planning on sitting inside anyhow.  The bartender\\/waitress was very friendly and attentive, which is always good!  We split a personal pizza, a salad and a Philly cheese steak sandwich. We got the thin crust pizza and I highly recommend you try it and it was cooked perfectly.  The Philly had a heap of meat on it and the roll it was served on was fresh and just really good.  The salad was also very fresh and they have really good Ranch dressing (and I am a Ranch snob!)  So, I would say this is better than just \"bar food\" it seems to be teetering on fresh ingredients and someone in the back does care about what they are doing.  I will be back for lunch and or dinner soon.\n",
